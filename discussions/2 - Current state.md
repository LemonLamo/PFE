# 2- Platform's Current State

## Architecture

The platform is based on a single monolithic Laravel application. Code is organised following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

## Functionalities

- Personnel management
- Roles & Permissions
- EHR management (Visits, Hospitiliastions, Tests...etc)
- Beds & Rooms
- Medecines stock
- Codifications

## Critiques

- This application is built on a single monolithic application, making it hard to maintain (bugfixes, evolution...) and scale.
- Very low level of isolation. If an attacker gains access, the entire database is compromised.
